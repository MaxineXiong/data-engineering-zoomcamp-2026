# Module 2 Homework


## Quiz Questions

1) Within the execution for `Yellow` Taxi data for the year `2020` and month `12`: what is the uncompressed file size (i.e. the output file `yellow_tripdata_2020-12.csv` of the `extract` task)?
- 128.3 MiB ✔️
- 134.5 MiB
- 364.7 MiB
- 692.6 MiB

**Explanation**

The file size is taken from the execution metrics of the `extract` task in Kestra.

This was obtained by running the flow **`08_gcp_taxi.yaml`** with the following inputs:
- taxi = `yellow`
- year = `2020`
- month = `12`

After the execution finished, I checked the Metrics tab of the run. The upload_to_gcs task reports the size of the uncompressed CSV file in bytes: 134,481,400 bytes
![Yellow taxi 2020-12 CSV file size](../../images/02_q1_yellow_2020_12_file_size.png)


Converting bytes to MiB:
134,481,400 ÷ (1024 × 1024) ≈ 128.3 MiB


2) What is the rendered value of the variable `file` when the inputs `taxi` is set to `green`, `year` is set to `2020`, and `month` is set to `04` during execution?
- `{{inputs.taxi}}_tripdata_{{inputs.year}}-{{inputs.month}}.csv` 
- `green_tripdata_2020-04.csv` ✔️
- `green_tripdata_04_2020.csv`
- `green_tripdata_2020.csv`

**Solution**
The file variable is defined using Kestra template expressions and is rendered at runtime by replacing each placeholder with the corresponding input value:
- inputs.taxi → green
- inputs.year → 2020
- inputs.month → 04

After rendering, the final value becomes: green_tripdata_2020-04.csv. This matches the naming convention used by the NYC TLC monthly dataset.

**Context for Questions 3–5**

Questions 3–5 are answered by querying **BigQuery external tables** managed by the Kestra GCP pipeline.
Each external table points directly to a monthly CSV file stored in Google Cloud Storage, without loading the data into the final partitioned tables.

3) How many rows are there for the `Yellow` Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020?
- 13,537.299
- 24,648,499 ✔️
- 18,324,219
- 29,430,127

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM (
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata_2020_01_ext`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata_2020_02_ext`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata_2020_03_ext`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata_2020_04_ext`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata_2020_05_ext`

  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata_2020_11_ext`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata_2020_12_ext`
);
```

4) How many rows are there for the `Green` Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020?
- 5,327,301
- 936,199
- 1,734,051 ✔️
- 1,342,034

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM (
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.green_tripdata_2020_01_ext`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.green_tripdata_2020_02_ext`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.green_tripdata_2020_03_ext`

  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.green_tripdata_2020_11_ext`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `zoomcamp.green_tripdata_2020_12_ext`
);
```

**Note on row counts and query approach (Questions 3–4)**

The row counts in Questions 3 and 4 are calculated from **external tables**, not from the final merged BigQuery tables.

Each external table corresponds to a single monthly CSV file in GCS (e.g. `yellow_tripdata_2020_01_ext`). Since BigQuery does not support wildcard queries across multiple external tables, the total row count for a year is computed by explicitly combining all monthly tables using `UNION ALL`.

This approach ensures the counts reflect the raw CSV data exactly, rather than the deduplicated records stored in the final partitioned tables.

5) How many rows are there for the `Yellow` Taxi data for the March 2021 CSV file?
- 1,428,092
- 706,911
- 1,925,152 ✔️
- 2,561,031

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM `zoomcamp.yellow_tripdata_2021_03_ext`;
```

6) How would you configure the timezone to New York in a Schedule trigger?
- Add a `timezone` property set to `EST` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration  
- Add a `timezone` property set to `America/New_York` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration ✔️
- Add a `timezone` property set to `UTC-5` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration
- Add a `location` property set to `New_York` in the `Schedule` trigger configuration  

**Explanation**

Kestra schedule triggers run in UTC by default.
To align executions with New York local time, the timezone must be explicitly configured.

Using the IANA timezone `America/New_York` ensures the schedule correctly handles daylight saving time transitions. Fixed offsets such as `EST` or `UTC-5` do not account for DST and may result in incorrect execution times.

Example:
```yaml
triggers:
  - id: green_schedule
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.trigger.Schedule
    cron: "0 9 1 * *"
    timezone: America/New_York
    inputs:
      taxi: green
```
